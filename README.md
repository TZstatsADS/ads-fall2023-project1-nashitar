### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: The effects of demographic factors on happy moments
+ This project is conducted by Nashita Rahman

+ Project summary:  The LDA models shed light on how the nature of happy moments varies across different demographic groups. Young individuals tend to find happiness in a diverse range of activities such as gaming, music, and work-related achievements, while older individuals focus more on everyday life, work, celebrations, and outdoor activities. Men express happiness through a wide array of topics including work, gaming, and fixing things, whereas women emphasize personal and emotional experiences, celebrations, and memories. Married individuals highlight the importance of relationships and interactions in their happy moments, while single individuals place greater emphasis on work-related and financial sources of happiness. Parenthood, regardless of the presence or absence of children, underscores the significance of family, but those without children lean toward happiness derived from various activities and experiences. These findings illuminate the multifaceted nature of happiness, influenced by age, gender, marital status, and parenthood, each contributing unique dimensions to what brings joy to people's lives.
